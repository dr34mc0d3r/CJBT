Grok:
6. Pattern Recognition
Use Case: Detecting chart patterns (e.g., head and shoulders, double tops) for technical trading.

How It Works: CNNs in PyTorch can be trained on candlestick charts or time series data to recognize patterns associated with reversals or continuations.

Signals: 
Buy: Detection of a bullish pattern (e.g., inverse head and shoulders).

Sell: Detection of a bearish pattern (e.g., double top).

Example: A CNN scans a price chart image and identifies a breakout pattern, triggering a buy signal.


DeepSeek:
5. Pattern Recognition in Technical Indicators
Goal: Identify complex patterns in technical indicators.

Models: CNNs or Attention-based networks.

Use Case: Train a model to recognize chart patterns (e.g., head-and-shoulders, double tops) or divergences in indicators.

Example: CNN detects a bullish divergence in RSI â†’ buy signal.
